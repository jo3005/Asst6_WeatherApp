# Asst6_WeatherApp
Create a weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API 

# Description
This website allows the user to search for the weather in a particular location that they enter into a form box.  The OpenWeather API is used to supply the data.  Current weather conditions and for the following five days are provided.  A list of recent search locations are stored so the user can switch between cities. When the user changes to a new city, the information on the screen reflects this change.

All data is presented as required except for the UV index, which will be implemented in a future update.
